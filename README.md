- The dataset provides a wealth of customer-specific information (including id, gender, customer type, travel type, age, and class from columns 1 to 6). In addition, it incorporates ratings (on a scale of 0 to 5) relating to various service attributes such as wifi service and seat comfort (from column 8 to 21). Furthermore, it encapsulates flight distance (column 7), departure and arrival delay minutes, and general satisfaction remarks (categorized as satisfied or neutral/dissatisfied). This project aims to leverage these data points in pursuit of improving the overall customer experience.
